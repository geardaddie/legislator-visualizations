Further, it is been the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s\n\t\t\t position since 1992 that \u201c[a]ny educational setting that does not meet the\n\t\t\t communication and related needs of a child who is deaf does not allow for\n\t\t\t the provision of [a Free Appropriate Public Education] and cannot be\n\t\t\t considered the [Least Restrictive Environment] for that child. Just as the\n\t\t\t [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act] requires placement in the\n\t\t\t regular educational setting when it is appropriate for the unique needs of\n\t\t\t a child who is deaf, it also requires placement outside of the regular\n\t\t\t educational setting when the child\u2019s needs cannot be met in that setting\u201d\n\t\t\t (Deaf Students Education Services: Policy Guidance,\u201d 57 Fed.

Nevertheless, it has been contended that few deaf\n\t\t\t and hard of hearing students are receiving full access to language and\n\t\t\t communication in the regular education setting, and few have access to a\n\t\t\t critical mass of peers. This lack of language and communication access\n\t\t\t contributes to students\u2019 social isolation and to the inability of\n\t\t\t graduates to achieve academic outcomes on par with those of their hearing\n\t\t\t peers.

Given that nationally students who are deaf or hard of\n\t\t\t hearing require more language and communication access and more support to\n\t\t\t acquire services and skills than they are currently receiving, and given\n\t\t\t that provision of currently required instruction and placement for such\n\t\t\t students cannot be adequately assured, IDEA must be strengthened and\n\t\t\t supplemented to ensure that deaf and hard of hearing students truly\n\t\t\t receive a free and appropriate public education.", "@display-inline": "yes-display-inline"}, "enum": {"#tail": "\n              ", "#text": "(6)"}, "@id": "HB11222A268174FCCB255A3B40987FB80", "#text": "\n              "}, {"#tail": "\n            ", "text": {"#tail": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "#text": "A prerequisite to better meeting these needs is every State and local educational agency's\n\t\t\t identification and proper evaluation of each student who is deaf or hard\n\t\t\t of hearing, regardless of whether such student may have other, even\n\t\t\t potentially more significant, disabilities. While IDEA does not mandate\n\t\t\t that State and local educational agencies classify students into specific\n\t\t\t disability categories, the widespread use of IDEA's disability categories\n\t\t\t has led to a sizable undercount of deaf and hard of hearing students and,\n\t\t\t consequently, a lack of recognition of the extent of the systemic need for\n\t\t\t the delivery of appropriate instructional services provided by personnel\n\t\t\t initially trained and continually supported to meet such students\u2019 unique\n\t\t\t educational needs.
